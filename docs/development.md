# Working on Git Lanes

The README says what this tool is and how to run it. This page says how it is built, what
holds it together, and what has already cost time here. Nothing below repeats the README.

## Two names, and only one of them moved

**What a person reads is `Git Lanes`, with a space. What a machine reads is `gitlanes`, without
one.** The first is the product name, the window's title, the page's title and the word in the
bar. The second is everything a rename would break rather than improve, and it is deliberately
untouched:

- `identifier` in `tauri.conf.json`, which is what names the webview's own folder. Change it and
  every setting, every panel width and every remembered scope is left behind in a folder nothing
  reads any more.
- `%APPDATA%\gitlanes\`, which holds `actions.json` and `repos.json`. Change it and a project's
  commands, its trunks, the line that opens a diff and the list of opened repositories are all
  orphaned at once, silently, on somebody who only wanted the new version.
- The crate, the Python file, the launcher, `gitlanes-web`, and the temporary folders a run and a
  diff are given. Names in code, which do not take spaces and gain nothing by changing.

The one thing the rename does cost is unavoidable: the installer is named after the product and
so is the folder it installs into, so a version under the new name lands beside the old one
rather than over it. The old one is uninstalled by hand, once.

**A space in the product name comes back as a dot on the release page.** The installer is built as
`Git Lanes_<version>_x64-setup.exe` and GitHub attaches it as `Git.Lanes_...`, because that is what
it does to a space in an asset's name. The release workflow finds the file by a glob rather than by
name, so nothing breaks; what has to agree with it is the README, which tells somebody what to look
for on that page and therefore spells the name GitHub gives rather than the one the bundler does.

**Renaming the repository on GitHub broke the build, and not where it said.** A runner checks out
into `D:\a\<name>\<name>`, and `src-tauri/target` is cached across runs with that path written all
through it. Restored under the new name, the build went looking for a Tauri permissions file in a
folder that no longer existed and reported that, which sends whoever reads it into the bundler
rather than into the cache. The repository's name is part of the cache key now, in both workflows,
so a rename invalidates it instead of poisoning it.

## The shape of it

Three pieces, and the first rule follows from there being two of the second:

```
web/        a React front end, bundled by Bun. It never knows which backend answers.
server/     one backend, Python, over HTTP. What a browser talks to.
src-tauri/  the other backend, Rust, in process. What the desktop window talks to.
```

**Both backends answer the same shapes, and a change to one is a change to both.** The front
end picks between them once, in `web/src/api.ts`, by looking for `window.__TAURI__`. Everything
above that file is written as if there were one backend. Break the symmetry and the tool works
in the browser and not in the window, or the reverse, and nothing says so until someone opens
the other one.

**Two commands break that symmetry, and each for its own reason.** `pick_folder` is a thing a
browser genuinely cannot do: there is no native folder dialog in a page. The action runner is a
thing the HTTP backend must not do: it answers on `127.0.0.1`, where any page in any browser can
post to it without ever reading the answer, so a route that ran a command there would be a build
any website could start. Either way the command lives in Rust alone, and `api.ts` says so out
loud with a flag the front end asks about, the way `canPickFolder` and `canRunActions` do, so the
page has somewhere else to go rather than a call that fails.

There are no Tauri JS packages. The window is driven through `window.__TAURI__` globals and
commands this repository declares itself, in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`. Adding a Tauri plugin
would mean adding its JS package and its capability file; adding a plain crate and one command
does not. That is why the folder picker is `rfd` in a `pick_folder` command rather than
`tauri-plugin-dialog`.

## Building it

```
cd web && bun install && bun run build     the page, into web/dist
cd src-tauri && cargo build                the window, which embeds web/dist
cargo tauri icon icons/source.png          the icons, once
```

`bun run build` runs `tsc -b` first, so it is also the type check. `bunx oxlint --deny-warnings src`
is the lint, and it must be silent.

**A fresh clone or worktree cannot build the window until the page and the icons exist.** Both
`web/dist` and `src-tauri/icons/*` are ignored by git, and `cargo build` fails on each in turn
with an error that does not name the cause. In a worktree, copying `src-tauri/icons` from the
main checkout is quicker than regenerating them.

`cargo check` from a worktree can borrow the main checkout's build cache with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, which turns minutes into seconds. `cargo build` cannot, or it would write
over the binary the main checkout is running.

## Checking the work

**The Python backend is the fast way to see a change.** It serves `web/dist`, so a rebuilt page
is one reload away, with no Rust involved:

```
py -3 server/gitlanes.py --repo <a repository> --port 7420
```

Drive the page and measure it rather than guessing. Widths, row counts and timings are all
readable from the page, and every layout claim in this repository was settled that way.

**Then check the Rust before merging, always, even when the change looks like front end only.**
That rule was written the day a lot was merged on the strength of a browser pass alone and did
not compile.

Every push runs those same three gates again, in `.github/workflows/build.yml`, on Windows and in
one job because the Rust build embeds the page and the icons. What it adds is a machine nobody
here has seen; it does not stand in for the pass before the push.

A webview that is not on screen keeps running scripts but stops compositing. CSS transitions
then never advance and scroll events are never delivered, so a panel reads as stuck and a
virtualised list as frozen. Neither is a bug. Check `document.hidden` before believing either,
disable the transition to measure a final position, and dispatch a synthetic `scroll` by hand.

## What holds the front end together

**An answer carries the question it answers.** `useGraph`, `CommitPanel` and `Sidebar` all store
what they were asked for beside what they got, and show the answer only if the question still
matches. That is what stops a repository's graph from appearing under another one's name for a
frame. `useGraph` goes further and numbers its reads, so a slow one landing after a newer one is
dropped rather than putting back what it replaced.

**The graph is read whole, once per repository.** Measured on six thousand commits, reading
everything cost eighty milliseconds more than reading four hundred: what a read costs is
spawning git, not walking history. Paging was therefore paying that cost over and over for
nothing, and it is gone. Nothing is fetched while scrolling.

**Nothing reloads on a timer.** A cheap fingerprint of the refs, of HEAD and of the working tree
is polled every two and a half seconds, and the graph is read again only when it moves. A blind
reload would move two megabytes per repository per tick. A hidden tab polls nothing.

**The user's own file is in that fingerprint too**, by its date and its size rather than by its
contents, and it is the only thing in there that belongs to no repository. A project's commands
and the branches its work lands on are both read from it, and saving it is a change git cannot
see: without it in the fingerprint, an edit sat unread until the window was reloaded by hand.
What that fingerprint moving carries is the whole answer, so the commands are read again from the
same beat rather than from a poll of their own.

**Every row of the graph is a grid of its own**, so the browser cannot line the columns up: an
automatic width would land differently on each row. The author and date columns are therefore
measured in JavaScript, over the loaded commits, with a canvas and the font they are drawn in,
and passed down as `--who` and `--when`. Do not be tempted by `ch`: it answers for the digit
zero of the font the *element* inherits, which is not the font the column is drawn in, and it
was eighteen percent wrong here.

**The text filter dims, the others remove.** Author, date and paths are given to git, which does
not return what it leaves out. The text field stays in the browser and fades what does not match,
because that is what keeps the shape of the graph readable while looking for one commit in it.
Two behaviours, on purpose.

**A scope is a ref spelled in full**: `ref:refs/heads/dev`, `ref:refs/tags/v0.7.5`. Git reads a
tag as a starting point exactly as it reads a branch, so nothing distinguishes them here. The
long spelling is also what tells a tag `dev` from a branch `dev`, and what keeps a ref named
like an option from being read as one. A scope that does not spell `refs/...` is no scope.

**The two side panels are the same thing mirrored.** Both are columns, both open at `MIN_WIDTH`
and stop there too, both are dragged by their inner edge through `usePanelWidth`, both are turned
off in the menu. That number lives in `panel.ts` and is one number on purpose, twice over: two
columns that opened at different widths read as two different kinds of thing, and a column that
opened wider than it can be pulled is a guess about somebody's screen made before it is known.
A width dragged by hand is remembered, so the guess is only ever made once. What the menu holds
is what someone decides once; what a panel header holds is what someone decides while looking at
it. The commit panel has a third state, gone until a click and closed by its cross, which is a
choice in the menu rather than where the window starts.

**The user's own file has one key that names no repository**, `diff`, and that is why it is read
as a plain object rather than as a table of projects. Read as a table it would fail on that one
key and answer an empty table, which is to say it would hide every command in the file rather
than the line it could not place. Every other key is an absolute path, so nothing else collides
with it. The Python backend already skips what is not a path, and there is nothing there to add.

## Traps already paid for

- **`git for-each-ref` shortens `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` to `origin`**, so filtering remote
  refs by a name ending in `/HEAD` misses it and a bare `origin` appears among the branches.
  Filter on `%(symref)` being non-empty instead, which is what that ref actually is.
- **A grid item with `justify-self: end` and no `min-width: 0` will not go under its content.**
  In a track squeezed to zero it keeps its full width and hangs leftwards, over its neighbour.
  That is what printed ref labels on top of commit subjects.
- **`%(committerdate)` is empty for an annotated tag**, which is an object of its own.
  `%(creatordate)` answers for both kinds, and `%(*objectname)` is the commit an annotated tag
  points at, empty for a lightweight one.
- **PowerShell's `Set-Content` and `Out-File -Encoding utf8` write a BOM.** Use
  `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` with `UTF8Encoding($false)` for anything this repository reads.

## Writing here

**CONTRIBUTING holds the branches, the commit subjects, the changelog and how a release goes
out**, and it holds them once: `dev` is where work lands, `main` is what has been released, and a
version leaves by a tag. What follows is the part about this codebase rather than about that
process.

Comments explain why, never what. Most of this codebase has none, and the ones it has are there
because someone would otherwise undo the reason.

Prose here and in the README uses plain ASCII punctuation and no dash between two spaces.
